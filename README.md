# README
## GMRES with Preconditioning
### CS 575 (Final Project)
#### John Tran
#### Spring 2023

### Requirements

- `Python >=3.10` (`match` case statements)

#### Packages

- `numpy`
- `scipy` (for sparse format)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting)

**Note**: need to have `LaTeX` installed to generate the formatted text in the plots (can comment out `rc('text', 
usetex=True)` at the beginning of `main.py`) and readjust correspond lines in `plot_figures()` function (look at 
errors produced to find lines)

### Run Code

`cd` into the root of the repo and run the following command below

```python{cmd}
$ python main.py
```

### Extra Files

- `output.txt` has a copy of the output given when running the program (plots will be given separately to reduce 
  code size)
